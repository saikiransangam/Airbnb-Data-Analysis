### Introduction:

Airbnb is an American vacation rental online marketplace company based in San Francisco, California. Airbnb maintains and hosts a marketplace, accessible to consumers on its website or via an app. Through the service, users can arrange lodging, primarily homestays, and tourism experiences or list their properties for rental. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.

The company has attracted criticism for increasing rent prices in cities where it operates, and creating nuisances for those living near leased properties. In response, the company has attracted regulatory attention from cities such as San Francisco and New York City, and the European Union. It has also faced challenges from the hotel industry and other, similar companies.

New York, New York isn’t this everyone’s favourite city? Tourism is a vital industry for New York City. When we plan any vacation or travel, the first thing that we look for are hotels, motels or airbnbs. Comparitively Airbnb's are becoming more famous and reliable since they give us a homely feeling even when we travel to a new city. This is one of unique aspects as of why airbnb are gaining its hand over the other Hotels and Motels. Also we have observed that airbnb's are more cheap when compared to the Hotels and Motels.

### Objective:
